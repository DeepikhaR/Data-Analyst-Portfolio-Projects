__1)COVID Analysis__


  In this COVID-19 analysis project, I used data-driven techniques to provide a deep understanding of the global pandemic. 


  

  ->Top Countries Analysis: I conducted an analysis, utilizing Plotly to craft a variety of informative charts, to pinpoint the countries mostly 
  impacted by COVID-19. These visualizations showcased the nations with the highest total cases, maximum deaths, total recoveries, and active 
  cases. 

  ->Cases over Time: Through interactive line charts, I meticulously tracked the progression of COVID-19 cases over time. 

  ->Population vs. Testing Ratio: I explored the ratio between a country's population and the total number of COVID-19 tests administered. This 
  ratio showed the effectiveness of testing strategies and testing coverage relative to the population.

  ->Death and Recovery Ratios: By assessing the ratio between the number of deaths and total recoveries, I understood the severity of the 
  pandemic in different regions. 

  ->Test-to-Confirmed Ratio: I investigated the ratio between the total tests conducted and confirmed cases. This metric offered insights into a 
  country's testing efficiency .

  ->Death-to-Serious Cases Ratio: Analyzing the ratio between deaths and serious cases, I provided a view of the pandemic's impact on individuals 
  with severe illness.

  ->Most Affected Countries: Finally, I identified and ranked the most affected countries based on total deaths, total recoveries, and active 
   cases.

__2)Sales Analysis__



  In this project, I focused on analyzing sales data to extract valuable insights and answer business questions.

  1)Data Cleaning: I cleaned the dataset by removing null values and duplicated entries, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

  2)Monthly Sales: I identified the month with the highest sales, helping to pinpoint peak periods.

  3)Top-Performing City: By analyzing the data, I determined which city generated the maximum number of orders, providing valuable information 
  for targeting marketing efforts.

  4)Best-Selling Product: I identified the product that sold the most units and reasons behind its popularity.

  5)Product Trend Analysis: I examined the sales trend of the best-selling products over time.

  6)Products often sold together:  I explored which products are frequently sold together .

__3)Youtube Analysis__



  In this project, I conducted analysis of YouTube data to uncover valuable insights. 

  1)Sentiment Analysis: I performed sentiment analysis on comments to understand the emotional response of viewers.

  2)WordCloud Analysis: Utilizing word clouds, I visualized the most frequent terms in the positive and negative comments .

  3)Most Liked Category: I determined the category of videos that received the most likes, offering insights into viewer preferences.

  4)Audience Engagement: I assessed whether the audience is actively engaging with the content by analyzing the like rate,dislike rate,comments 
  count rate.

  5)Likes vs. Views: I explored the relationship between likes and views, providing valuable insights into viewer behavior.

  6)Trending Video Channels: I identified which YouTube channels had the largest number of trending videos.

  Throughout this analysis, I used Python libraries such as Pandas for data cleaning, Seaborn for visualization, and Plotly for interactive data 
  exploration. This project provides a deeper understanding of YouTube trends and audience behavior.
